# 🎫 Ticket Full Stack App

A full-stack event ticketing platform built using **Spring Boot** (backend) and **React + Vite + TypeScript** (frontend).

---


## 🧩 Project Overview

Let's break down the main components of our event ticketing system.

Our system needs to handle event creation, ticket sales, sales monitoring, and ticket validation — the complete event management lifecycle.

The platform will serve three types of users:

1. Event _organizers_
2. Event _attendees_
3. Event _staff_

Each user type has their own needs and way of using the system.

2. **Design REST API** and the application's architecture
3. **Project Setup**, including security
4. **Domain Implementation**
5. **Event Creation & Management**
6. **Ticket Sale & Purchase**
7. **Ticket Validation**
8. **Sales Reporting**
